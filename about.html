              Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books
              published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan
              Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists
              Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of
              Suspense #39 in 1962 (cover dated March 1963) and received his own
              title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron
              Man became a founding member of the superhero team, the Avengers,
              alongside Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories,
              individually and with the Avengers, have been published
              consistently since the character's creation.<br />Iron Man is the
              superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a businessman
              and engineer who runs the weapons manufacturing company Stark
              Industries. When Stark was captured in a war zone and sustained a
              severe heart wound, he built his Iron Man armor and escaped his
              captors. Iron Man's suits of armor grant him superhuman strength,
              flight, energy projection, and other abilities. The character was
              created in response to the Vietnam War as Lee's attempt to create
              a likeable pro-war character. Since his creation, Iron Man has
              been used to explore political themes, with early Iron Man stories
              being set in the Cold War. The character's role as a weapons
              manufacturer proved controversial, and Marvel moved away from
              geopolitics by the 1970s. Instead, the stories began exploring
              themes such as civil unrest, technological advancement, corporate
              espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.

              Captain America is a superhero created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby
              who appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
              The character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1,
              published on December 20, 1940, by Timely Comics, a corporate
              predecessor to Marvel. Captain America's civilian identity is
              Steven "Steve" Rogers, a frail man enhanced to the peak of human
              physical perfection by an experimental "super-soldier serum" after
              joining the United States Army to aid the country's efforts in
              World War II. Equipped with an American flag-inspired costume and
              a virtually indestructible shield, Captain America and his
              sidekick Bucky Barnes clashed frequently with the villainous Red
              Skull and other members of the Axis powers. In the war's final
              days, an accident left Captain America frozen in a state of
              suspended animation until he was revived in modern times. He
              resumes his exploits as a costumed hero and becomes the leader of
              the superhero team the Avengers, but frequently struggles as a
              "man out of time" to adjust to the new era.

              Black Panther is a superhero appearing in American comic books
              published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and
              artist-coplotter Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in
              Fantastic Four #52, published in July 1966. On Earth-616, Black
              Panther's birth name is T'Challa, and he is the son of the
              previous Black Panther, T'Chaka. He is the king and protector of
              the fictional African nation of Wakanda, a technologically
              advanced society drawing from a supply of vibranium, a fictional
              metal of extraordinary properties. Along with possessing enhanced
              abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking
              the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his
              proficiency in science, expertise in his nation's traditions,
              rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access
              to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies.
              The character became a member of the Avengers in 1968, and has
              continued that affiliation off and on in subsequent decades.

              Thor Odinson is a superhero appearing in American comic books
              published by Marvel Comics, based on the god from Old Norse
              religion and mythology, Thor (Þórr). Created by artist Jack Kirby,
              writer Stan Lee, and scripter Larry Lieber, the character first
              appeared in Journey into Mystery #83 (1962) and first received his
              own title with Thor #126 (1966). Thor is an adaptation of the
              deity of the same name from Norse mythology, and many aspects of
              Thor's character are based on his mythological counterpart. Comic
              books featuring Thor have been published across several volumes
              since the character's introduction. Thor is one of the gods of
              Asgard and the son of the Asgardian king Odin. In addition to his
              Asgardian strength and extended lifespan, Thor wields control over
              the weather, including rain and lightning. He also carries the
              enchanted hammer Mjolnir, that enhances his abilities and grants
              him the ability to fly. Thor was first introduced as the alter ego
              of surgeon Donald Blake, who acquired Thor's power, which was
              later revealed to be a fabrication by Thor's father. Thor has
              since assumed other human identities and sometimes ruled as king
              of Asgard.

              The Hulk is a superhero appearing in American comic books
              published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist
              Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of The
              Incredible Hulk (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the
              character, who has dissociative identity disorder (DID), is
              primarily represented by the alter ego Hulk, an immense,
              green-skinned, hulking brute, possessing a limitless degree of
              physical strength, and the alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a
              physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved
              physicist, both of whom typically resent each other. Following his
              accidental exposure to gamma rays while saving the life of Rick
              Jones during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is
              physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional
              stress, at or against his will. This transformation often leads to
              destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner's
              civilian life. The Hulk's level of strength is usually conveyed
              proportionate to his anger level. Commonly portrayed as a raging
              savage, the Hulk has been represented with other alter egos, from
              a mindless, destructive force (War) to a brilliant warrior
              (World-Breaker), a self-hating protector (the Devil Hulk), a
              genius scientist in his own right (Doc Green), and a gangster (Joe
              Fixit).

              Spider-Man is a superhero in American comic books published by
              Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve
              Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing
              Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books.
              Considered one of the most popular and commercially successful
              superheroes, he has been featured in comic books, television
              shows, films, video games, novels, and plays.<br />Spider-Man has
              the secret identity of Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter was
              depicted as a teenage high-school student and an orphan raised by
              his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents,
              Richard and Mary Parker, died in a plane crash. Lee, Ditko, and
              later creators had the character deal with the struggles of
              adolescence and young adulthood and gave him many supporting
              characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry
              Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the
              Black Cat; and enemies such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin,
              and Venom.<br />In his origin story, Peter gets his superhuman
              spider powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive
              spider. These powers include superhuman strength, speed, agility,
              reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination, and balance; clinging
              to surfaces and ceilings like a spider; and detecting danger with
              his precognition ability called "spider-sense". He builds
              wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial
              spider-webs of his own design, which he uses both for fighting and
              travel, or "web swinging" across the city. Peter Parker initially
              used his powers for personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was
              killed by a thief that he could have stopped but did not, Peter
              began to use his powers to fight crime as Spider-Man.
